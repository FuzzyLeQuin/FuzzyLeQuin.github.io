    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>
        As most of us know, being a hunter is hard
        <br>work I as a veteran have decided to spend
        <br> my free time teaching scrubs like you
        <br> to git gud at a franchise that really
        <br>wants you to fail.
    </p>
    <h2>What will this site have?</h2>
    <p>
        This site will have many tools to help to
        <br>help the common hunter. This ranging from
        <br>info on mantles, info on monsters
        <br> and even advice on monsters and weapons!
